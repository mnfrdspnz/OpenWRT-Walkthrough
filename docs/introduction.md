# Introduction

## 1.1 Overview of OpenWRT

**What is OpenWRT?**
OpenWRT is a Linux-based firmware for embedded devices, primarily designed for routers. It transforms a device's firmware into a fully customizable and extensible operating system, giving users and developers the flexibility to tailor it to their specific needs.

**Key Features and Advantages:**
- **Customizability**: OpenWRT provides full control over the device's features and functions, allowing users to install packages and make configurations that aren't possible with standard firmware.
- **Extensive Package Repository**: Users have access to a large collection of software packages that can be easily installed and updated, enhancing the device's capabilities.
- **Security**: Regular updates and the ability to configure security features such as firewalls, VPNs, and encrypted connections make OpenWRT a secure choice.
- **Performance**: OpenWRT often improves the performance of devices by optimizing the underlying software and providing tools for fine-tuning.
- **Community Support**: A large and active community provides support, documentation, and new features, ensuring continuous improvement and innovation.
- **Flexibility**: OpenWRT supports a wide range of devices, from consumer routers to professional-grade hardware, making it suitable for various applications.
